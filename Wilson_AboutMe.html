                        <p class="club15">Engineering. Work. Success. My name is Keagan Wilson and I long for success in the field of Engineering. Although engineering will require at least four years of rigorous schooling, including at least a Bachelor's degree, training in programming and other technical subjects, and possibly prior years of knowledge from high school or extracurricular courses, I aspire to be a part of it because of my passion for technology and innovation. I am already pursuing this field by taking courses relevant to the subject matter in high school, and I will continue to do so until I reach my goal of succeeding in the field of engineering.</p>
                        <p class="club15">Success in the field of engineering comes from versatility, reliability, and ambition. I believe I possess these traits and they can all be seen in my achievements. A personal achievement of mine being the acquirement of Algebra with Trigonometry in my Freshman year, which perfectly reflects all those traits. The ambition comes from the desire to make my way towards that subject. the reliability comes from the work I put into projects and grades, making sure not to let anyone down whether it be partners in a project or myself. There is versatility in the different types of work I completed whether it be a group project or an individual assessment. In terms of engineering, I participate in a class for Engineering within high school. Another thing I participate in is Patch Club, which works to help less fortunate children. Theses experiences have shown me my capabilities, basically the extent of how far I will work and that will help me work through the difficulty of engineering. However, I feel there is room for improve since I could also reduce my procrastination of tasks that span longer periods of time. In the same I believe in technological innovation, I believe as a person I can change for the better.</p>
                        <p class="club15">To boil things down, I am capable of getting work done and working towards my goal of succeeding in the field of engineering. Accompanied by my versatility, my reliability, my ambition, my achievements in advanced placement, and my past experiences, I long for a position in engineering. Thank you for the time you took out of your day to read this, and I hope you explore the rest of my website.</p>
