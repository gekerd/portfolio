                    <p><strong>Project: </strong>The Pen Pal Machine (P1.1.6 Compound Machine)</p>
                    <p><strong>Course: </strong>Principles of Engineering (POE)</p>
                    <p><strong>Duration: </strong>8/29/2018 - 9/7/2018</p>
                    <p><strong>Objective: </strong>Design, build and test a working prototype that completes a simple task through a complex organization of mechanisms.</p>
                    <p><strong>Type of Project: </strong>Group Project</p>
                    <p>This was the first project experienced in POE. We started off with 
                    a narrative about the people of a town that uses compound machines to do basic tasks and they needed more machines.
                    Our goal was to make a compound machine that had four mechanisms and would only receive effort force at one location.
                    We decided that the simple task we would complete would be pressing a pen.
                    The four mechanisms we used were sprockets, a wheel, a gear train, and a pulley.
                    My responsibility was to complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OgJlftkPQuyhByKwnhKZxg6BBHDjZcw9lWNnN7qzxg0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">documentation</a> along with another groupmate.
                    I worked on that and one of the mechanisms, the gear train.
                    The gear train was a simple one that consited of 6 gears with the first being attached to a sprocket.
                    The final gear had to be attached to the pulley system, which had a carriage on it and pressed down on the pen.
                    Time was the main problem as sometimes I felt rushed. 
                    However, this was overall a very good project that really showed how much I had improved in my skills of building, something that I had not been used to at the time.</p>
