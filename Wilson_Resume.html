One of the best experiences I had this year was going on the field trip to Cal Maritime. At Cal Maritime, I got to experience being on a ship and learned about the various majors offered by the college. Some are common like Mechanical Engineering, but others I’ve never heard about like Oceanography. A group of peers and I were given a tour by a student from the school. He was kind and offered insight on what happens at Cal Maritime. The students gain experience by staying on the boat for months. An interesting fact was that towards the start of the journey, the boat has to be at a precise angle to reach the correct destination as even the slightest miscalculation can send them to another country. Before the tour though, there was a presentation where I learned that a lot of the majors taught at the school are in demand and once students graduate, they tend to make high salaries. This made me realize that someone doesn’t have to have a mainstream major like Computer Science or Mechanical Engineering to be an engineer. There are a plethora of majors for engineers and now I know the world of engineering is bigger than how I originally imagined it to be.

            	<p class="col-xs-9" style="font-size: 14px;" class="club15">Field trips aren’t the only things with the ability to teach lessons focusing on engineering. This year, many guest speakers came and took time out of their day to teach me and my peers about their experiences. Two speakers who stood out to me were Tim Rodriguez and Cristiano Melo of BSK Associates. The firm gives consulting engineering and during their presentation I learned about aspects related to geology, the study of rock and earth. When structures are built, these are the people who investigate the soil and rocks in the area. They mentioned in the past they tested shallow and deep foundations as well as other soil work pertaining to the things like the construction of highways and schoolsites. Their enthusiasm and knowledge about soil and rocks, things that are everywhere and most people don’t find interesting, really inspired me to look at other fields of engineering that most people don’t hear about. Most people don’t know that when designing a building more than just structural material needs to be accounted for. Their presentation truly made me think about the different lines of engineering that go unheard of, yet are enjoyable and compensating.
